# Hot reload test

quick test attempting to test out hot-reloading of dlls in runtime with transferable state.
the fibbonaci module will slowly output the next fibbonaci number (either ascending or descending). It is possible to modify the code in runtime and
when the dll is swapped it will also attempt to transfer the state.
